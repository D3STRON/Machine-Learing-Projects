The self-attention mechanism is a critical component of the transformer architecture for natural language processing. Self-attention allows the model to selectively attend to different parts of the input sequence, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.

In the transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism operates on a sequence of embeddings $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $n$ is the length of the sequence and $d$ is the dimensionality of the embeddings. The self-attention mechanism computes a set of attention weights $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ that indicate the importance of each element in the sequence for computing the output representation of each element. The attention weights are computed as follows:

$$\mathbf{A} = \text{softmax}(\frac{\mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}_Q (\mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}_K)^T}{\sqrt{d}})$$

where $\mathbf{W}_Q$, $\mathbf{W}_K$, and $\mathbf{W}_V$ are learnable parameter matrices that project the input embeddings $\mathbf{X}$ into query, key, and value spaces, respectively. The attention weights are computed as a softmax over the dot products between the query and key projections, scaled by the square root of the embedding dimension.

Once the attention weights have been computed, the output representation $\mathbf{Y}$ is obtained by computing a weighted sum of the value projections $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}_V$ using the attention weights $\mathbf{A}$:

$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}_V)$$

The self-attention mechanism is applied multiple times in a transformer model, allowing the model to capture increasingly complex dependencies between the elements of the input sequence. The output of each self-attention layer is passed through a feedforward neural network before being passed to the next self-attention layer. The final output of the transformer model is obtained by passing the output of the last self-attention layer through a linear layer and applying a softmax activation function.
